## Idea

Navigation to the menu to press each button individually can be often uncomfortable because it requires scrolling to the desired button and selecting it. The idea behind `XRemote` is that all physical buttons are pre-mapped to specific category buttons, and a physical button directly sends an infrared signal. This allows the flipper device to be used as a remote rather than as a tool that has a remote.

## Learn new remote

`XRemote` also introduces a more user-friendly learning approach. Instead of having to manually name each button on the flipper when cloning a remote, the learning tool informs you upfront which buttons it will record. All you need to do is press the corresponding button on your existing remote, eliminating the need to name them individually.

## Custom Layout

To customize your layout, open the saved remote file, select `Edit` in the menu, and configure which infrared commands should be transmitted when physical buttons are pressed or held. These changes will be stored in the existing remote file, which means that the configuration of custom buttons can be different for all remotes.

## Standard file support

The application is compatible with standard `.ir` files. However, to ensure functionality, names within these files must align with the predefined naming scheme. If the button is not highlighted when pressed or the notification LED does not light up, the button with the appropriate name cannot be found in the file.

Button name | Description
------------|-------------------
`Power`     | Power
`Setup`     | Setup/Settings
`Input`     | Input/Source
`Menu`      | Menu
`List`      | List
`Info`      | Info
`Mode`      | Mode
`Back`      | Back
`Ok`        | Enter/Ok
`Up`        | Up
`Down`      | Down
`Left`      | Left
`Right`     | Right
`Mute`      | Mute
`Vol_up`    | Volume up
`Vol_dn`    | Volume down
`Ch_next`   | Next channel
`Ch_prev`   | Previous channel
`Next`      | Jump forward
`Prev`      | Jump backward
`Fast_fo`   | Fast forward
`Fast_ba`   | Fast backward
`Play_pa`   | Play/Pause
`Pause`     | Pause
`Play`      | Play
`Stop`      | Stop


## Alternative button names
In addition to the predefined names, `XRemote` uses alternative button names to make it as easy as possible to interact with different types of IR dumps. This means that if a button is not found in the file with the appropriate name, the application will try to find the same button with alternative names.

Alternate names are case insensitive and defined in the file: `SD Card/apps_data/flipper_xremote/alt_names.cfg`

If this file does not exist, it will be created automatically with default values when the application is launched. You are free to remove, edit or add any values you want to this file. Here is the alt_names.cfg file with default contents:

```

## Installation options

1. Install the latest stable version directly from the official [application catalog](https://lab.flipper.net/apps/flipper_xremote).
2. Install on any firmware from the community driven application catalog [FlipC](https://flipc.org/kala13x/flipper-xremote).
3. Manually install using `.fap` file:  
   - Download the `.fap` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/kala13x/flipper-xremote/releases) section of this repository.
   - Write the `.fap` file to an SD card using [qFlipper](https://docs.flipper.net/qflipper) or any your preferred SD card writer.

## Build options

1. If you already have the flipper zero firmware cloned on the Linux:
   - Connect your Flipper device to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Use deploy script from this repository to build and run the application on the device:

    ```bash
    ./deploy.sh --fw=/path/to/the/firmware
    ```
2. If you don't have the firmware or the Linux please refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/AppsOnSDCard.md) for build instructions.
